# 📊 Tanmay's Excel Sheet Analyzer

A Streamlit-based conversational assistant that lets users upload Excel spreadsheets, ask natural language questions, and get instant answers as text, tables, or visual charts — all powered by Google's Gemini API.

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload Excel files** (`.xlsx`)  
- **Natural language queries**, like “count countries with total > 100”  
- **Dynamic Python code generation**  GEMINI AI 
- **Visual slides**: bar charts, histograms, etc., can display in Streamlit  
- **Smart normalization**: case-insensitive and punctuation-agnostic matching  
- **Safe execution**: handles DataFrame, Series, scalar outputs

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanmay2607/neoat.git
   cd neoat
   ```
 2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## ⚙️ Setup
1. Sign up at GEMINI AI and obtain your API key.
2. Add the key to Streamlit secrets:
   In ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml (locally) or via the Streamlit Cloud UI:
   ```
   gemini_api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
## ▶️ Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## 🧠 How It Works
1. Upload an Excel file
2. Ask a question like:
"What is the average salary?"
"Show a bar chart of count by gender"
"List top 5 products by sales"
3. The app:
Normalizes your data
Sends schema + query to Gemini
Extracts and runs Python code generated by the model
Displays result back in Streamlit
